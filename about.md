<p>I am Sachin Suresh, a proactive Data Science graduate with a robust Computer Science background and currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Data and Decision Analytics at the University of Southampton. At Quantum Sports Analytics, I am actively contributing to a project developing a hybrid data collection platform for football player analytics, utilizing my expertise in machine learning, data preprocessing, and advanced algorithm implementation. Proficient in Python, R, SQL, and tools like Power BI and Google Analytics, I bring a solid understanding of machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras, statistical modeling, and database management.Proven ability to analyse complex datasets, develop predictive models, and deliver actionable insights through practical experience and academic projects. The uniqueness of the Analytics and Data Science program lies in its intersection of Engineering, Humanities, Arts, Social Sciences, and Management, setting me up for a continuous journey of learning.</p>
