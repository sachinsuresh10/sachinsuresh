            <h3 class="project-title">Data Analysis of Disasters</h3>
            <p class="project-description">Successfully acquired and pre-processed disaster data, using Random Forest imputation to handle missing values and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, enhancing overall data analysis efficiency. Achieved 98.6% accuracy in disaster classification with XG Boost, demonstrating the effectiveness of advanced classification algorithms.</p>
            <ul class="project-highlights">
                <li>Successfully acquired and pre-processed disaster data from the database, conducting thorough data cleaning, standardization, and employing Random Forest imputation to predict and fill missing values in the dataset.</li>
                <li>Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to streamline the interpretation and analysis of numerical data by effectively reducing dimensionality, thereby enhancing overall efficiency in data analysis processes.</li>
                <li>Employed multiple linear regression and XG Boost models to predict losses in USD and deaths, with XG Boost outperforming. Utilized correlation heatmaps to analyze variable relationships. Investigated the correlation between injuries and losses in USD using linear regression modeling, achieving an adjusted R-squared of 0.8924.</li>
                <li>Highlighted the versatility of classification algorithms like Random Forest, K-Means, and XG Boost in accurately predicting country and event types in disaster classification, achieving an impressive 98.6% accuracy with XG Boost.</li>
                <li>Utilized visual representations, including bar graphs showing the occurrence frequencies of deaths, missing persons, and injuries across different events, alongside bar graphs illustrating event counts per decade, to offer clear insights into dataset distribution and trends.</li>
                <li>This analysis provides an extensive exploration of disaster data, utilizing a variety of statistical and machine learning methods to derive valuable insights and patterns.</li>
